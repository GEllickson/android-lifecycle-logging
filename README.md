# android-lifecycle-logging
Sample app that logs important lifecycle events of components like Activities / Fragments, Services, etc. when the app is in use.

Intented to be used as reminder of the ordering of lifecycle callbacks, NOT as an indicator of best practices.

Touch the buttons on the main screen to launch or start/stop various components and then watch Logcat for logs with the name *LifecycleLogging*.
